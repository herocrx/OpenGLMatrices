    \title QtQuick Examples - Views
    \example quick/views
    \brief This is a collection of QML model and view examples
    \image qml-modelviews-example.png

    This is a collection of small QML examples relating to model and view functionality. They
    are focused on the views side, which is the visual representation of the data in the models.

    \section2 GridView and PathView demonstrate usage of these elements to display views.
    \snippet examples/quick/modelviews/gridview/gridview-example.qml 0

    \section2 Dynamic List demonstrates animation of runtime additions and removals to a ListView.

    The ListView.onAdd signal handler runs an animation when new items are added to the
    view, and the ListView.onRemove another when they are removed.
    \snippet examples/quick/modelviews/listview/dynamiclist.qml 0
    \snippet examples/quick/modelviews/listview/dynamiclist.qml 1

    \section2 Expanding Delegates demonstrates delegates that expand when activated.

    It has a complex delegate the size and appearance of which can change, displacing
    other items in the view.

    \snippet examples/quick/modelviews/listview/expandingdelegates.qml 3

    \section2 Highlight demonstrates adding a custom highlight to a ListView.
    \snippet examples/quick/modelviews/listview/highlight.qml 0

    \section2 Highlight Ranges shows the three different highlight range modes of ListView.
    \snippet examples/quick/modelviews/listview/highlightranges.qml 0
    \snippet examples/quick/modelviews/listview/highlightranges.qml 1
    \snippet examples/quick/modelviews/listview/highlightranges.qml 2

    \section2 Sections demonstrates the various section headers and footers available to ListView.
    \snippet examples/quick/modelviews/listview/sections.qml 0

    \section2 Packages demonstrates using Packages to transition delegates between two views.

    It has a Package which defines delegate items for each view and an item that can
    be transferred between delegates.

    \snippet examples/quick/modelviews/package/Delegate.qml 0

    A VisualDataModel allows the individual views to access their specific items from
    the shared package delegate.

    \snippet examples/quick/modelviews/package/view.qml 0

    \section2 VisualItemModel uses a VisualItemModel for the model instead of a ListModel.
