<p>In this chapter, we make this example a little bit more dynamic by introducing states and transitions.</p>
<p>We want our text to move to the bottom of the screen, rotate and become red when clicked.</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/declarative-tutorial3_animation.gif" alt="" /></p><p>Here is the QML code:</p>
<pre class="qml"></pre>
<a name="walkthrough"></a>
<h2>Walkthrough</h2>
<pre class="qml"></pre>
<p>First, we create a new <i>down</i> state for our text element. This state will be activated when the <a href="qml-qtquick2-mousearea.html">MouseArea</a> is pressed, and deactivated when it is released.</p>
<p>The <i>down</i> state includes a set of property changes from our implicit <i>default state</i> (the items as they were initially defined in the QML). Specifically, we set the <tt>y</tt> property of the text to <tt>160</tt>, the rotation to <tt>180</tt> and the <tt>color</tt> to red.</p>
<pre class="qml"></pre>
<p>Because we don't want the text to appear at the bottom instantly but rather move smoothly, we add a transition between our two states.</p>
<p><tt>from</tt> and <tt>to</tt> define the states between which the transition will run. In this case, we want a transition from the default state to our <i>down</i> state.</p>
<p>Because we want the same transition to be run in reverse when changing back from the <i>down</i> state to the default state, we set <tt>reversible</tt> to <tt>true</tt>. This is equivalent to writing the two transitions separately.</p>
<p>The <a href="qml-qtquick2-parallelanimation.html">ParallelAnimation</a> element makes sure that the two types of animations (number and color) start at the same time. We could also run them one after the other by using <a href="qml-qtquick2-sequentialanimation.html">SequentialAnimation</a> instead.</p>
<p>For more details on states and transitions, see <a href="qtquick-statesanimations-states.html">Qt Quick States</a> and the states and transitions example.</p>
