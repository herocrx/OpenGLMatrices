<p>C++ Inheritance and Coercion<p>This example builds on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="referenceexamples-properties.html">Extending QML - Object and List Property Types Example</a></li>
<li><a href="referenceexamples-adding.html">Extending QML - Adding Types Example</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Inheritance and Coercion Example shows how to use base classes to assign elements of more than one type to a property. It specializes the Person element developed in the previous examples into two elements - a <tt>Boy</tt> and a <tt>Girl</tt>.</p>
<pre class="qml"></pre>
<a name="declare-boy-and-girl"></a>
<h2>Declare Boy and Girl</h2>
<pre class="cpp"></pre>
<p>The Person class remains unaltered in this example and the Boy and Girl C++ classes are trivial extensions of it. As an example, the inheritance used here is a little contrived, but in real applications it is likely that the two extensions would add additional properties or modify the Person classes behavior.</p>

<h3>Define People as a base class</h3>
<p>The implementation of the People class itself has not changed since the previous example. However, as we have repurposed the People class as a common base for Boy and Girl, we want to prevent it from being instantiated from QML directly - an explicit Boy or Girl should be instantiated instead.</p>
<pre class="cpp"></pre>
<p>While we want to disallow instantiating Person from within QML, it still needs to be registered with the QML engine, so that it can be used as a property type and other types can be coerced to it.</p>
<a name="define-boy-and-girl"></a>
<h3>Define Boy and Girl</h3>
<p>The implementation of Boy and Girl are trivial.</p>
<pre class="cpp"></pre>
<p>All that is necessary is to implement the constructor, and to register the types and their QML name with the QML engine.</p>
<a name="running-the-example"></a>
<h2>Running the example</h2>
<p>The BirthdayParty element has not changed since the previous example. The celebrant and guests property still use the People type.</p>
<pre class="cpp"></pre>
<p>However, as all three types, Person, Boy and Girl, have been registered with the QML system, on assignment QML automatically (and type-safely) converts the Boy and Girl objects into a Person.</p>
<p>The main.cpp file in the example includes a simple shell application that loads and runs the QML snippet shown at the beginning of this page.</p>
