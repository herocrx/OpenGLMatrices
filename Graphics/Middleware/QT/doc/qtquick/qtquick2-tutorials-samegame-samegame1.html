<h3>Creating the application screen</h3>
<p>The first step is to create the basic QML items in your application.</p>
<p>To begin with, we create our Same Game application with a main screen like this:</p>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/declarative-adv-tutorial1.png" alt="" /></p><p>This is defined by the main application file, <tt>samegame.qml</tt>, which looks like this:</p>
<pre class="qml"></pre>
<p>This gives you a basic game window that includes the main canvas for the blocks, a &quot;New Game&quot; button and a score display.</p>
<p>One item you may not recognize here is the <a href="qml-qtquick2-systempalette.html">SystemPalette</a> item. This provides access to the Qt system palette and is used to give the button a more native look-and-feel.</p>
<p>Notice the anchors for the <tt>Item</tt>, <tt>Button</tt> and <tt>Text</tt> elements are set using group notation for readability.</p>
<a name="adding-button-and-block-components"></a>
<h3>Adding <tt>Button</tt> and <tt>Block</tt> components</h3>
<p>The <tt>Button</tt> item in the code above is defined in a separate component file named <tt>Button.qml</tt>. To create a functional button, we use the QML elements <a href="qml-qtquick2-text.html">Text</a> and <a href="qml-qtquick2-mousearea.html">MouseArea</a> inside a <a href="qml-qtquick2-rectangle.html">Rectangle</a>. Here is the <tt>Button.qml</tt> code:</p>
<pre class="qml"></pre>
<p>This essentially defines a rectangle that contains text and can be clicked. The <a href="qml-qtquick2-mousearea.html">MouseArea</a> has an <tt>onClicked()</tt> handler that is implemented to emit the <tt>clicked()</tt> signal of the <tt>container</tt> when the area is clicked.</p>
<p>In Same Game, the screen is filled with small blocks when the game begins. Each block is just an item that contains an image. The block code is defined in a separate <tt>Block.qml</tt> file:</p>
<pre class="qml"></pre>
<p>At the moment, the block doesn't do anything; it is just an image. As the tutorial progresses we will animate and give behaviors to the blocks. We have not added any code yet to create the blocks; we will do this in the next chapter.</p>
<p>We have set the image to be the size of its parent Item using <tt>anchors.fill: parent</tt>. This means that when we dynamically create and resize the block items later on in the tutorial, the image will be scaled automatically to the correct size.</p>
<p>Notice the relative path for the Image element's <tt>source</tt> property. This path is relative to the location of the file that contains the <a href="qml-qtquick2-image.html">Image</a> element. Alternatively, you could set the Image source to an absolute file path or a URL that contains an image.</p>
<p>You should be familiar with the code so far. We have just created some basic elements to get started. Next, we will populate the game canvas with some blocks.</p>
