<div class="descr"> <a name="details"></a>
<p>Suppose we want <tt>PieChart</tt> to have a &quot;clearChart()&quot; method that erases the chart and then emits a &quot;chartCleared&quot; signal. Our <tt>app.qml</tt> would be able to call <tt>clearChart()</tt> and receive <tt>chartCleared()</tt> signals like this:</p>
<pre class="qml"></pre>
<p class="centerAlign"><img src="images/extending-tutorial-chapter2.png" alt="" /></p><p>To do this, we add a <tt>clearChart()</tt> method and a <tt>chartCleared()</tt> signal to our C++ class:</p>
<pre class="cpp">    ...
    ...
    ...</pre>
<p>The use of <a href="../qtcore/qobject.html#Q_INVOKABLE">Q_INVOKABLE</a> makes the <tt>clearChart()</tt> method available to the Qt Meta-Object system, and in turn, to QML. Note that it could have been declared as as a Qt slot instead of using <a href="../qtcore/qobject.html#Q_INVOKABLE">Q_INVOKABLE</a>, as slots are also callable from QML. Both of these approaches are valid.</p>
<p>The <tt>clearChart()</tt> method simply changes the color to Qt::transparent, repaints the chart, then emits the <tt>chartCleared()</tt> signal:</p>
<pre class="cpp"></pre>
<p>Now when we run the application and click the window, the pie chart disappears, and the application outputs:</p>
<pre class="cpp">The chart has been cleared</pre>
<p>Try out the example yourself with the updated code in Qt's <tt>examples/quick/tutorials/extending/chapter2-methods</tt> directory.</p>
