<div class="descr"> <a name="details"></a>
<p>A common task when extending QML is to provide a new QML type that supports some custom functionality beyond what is provided by the built-in <a href="../qtquick/qtquick-qmltypereference.html">QtQuick types</a>. For example, this could be done to implement particular data models, or provide elements with custom painting and drawing capabilities, or access system features like network programming that are not accessible through built-in QML features.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will show how to use the C++ classes in the Qt Declarative module to extend QML. The end result will be a simple Pie Chart display implemented by several custom QML types connected together through QML features like bindings and signals, and made available to the QML runtime through a plugin.</p>
<p>To begin with, let's create a new QML type called &quot;PieChart&quot; that has two properties: a name and a color. We will make it available in an importable type namespace called &quot;Charts&quot;, with a version of 1.0&#x2e;</p>
<p>We want this <tt>PieChart</tt> type to be usable from QML like this:</p>
<pre class="cpp">import Charts <span class="number">1.0</span>

PieChart {
    width: <span class="number">100</span>; height: <span class="number">100</span>
    name: <span class="string">&quot;A simple pie chart&quot;</span>
    color: <span class="string">&quot;red&quot;</span>
}</pre>
<p>To do this, we need a C++ class that encapsulates this <tt>PieChart</tt> type and its two properties. Since QML makes extensive use of Qt's <a href="../qtcore/metaobjects.html#meta-object-system">meta object system</a>, this new class must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inherit from <a href="../qtcore/qobject.html">QObject</a></li>
<li>Declare its properties using the Q_PROPERTY macro</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is our <tt>PieChart</tt> class, defined in <tt>piechart.h</tt>:</p>
<pre class="cpp"></pre>
<p>The class inherits from <a href="../qtquick/qquickpainteditem.html">QQuickPaintedItem</a> because we want to override <a href="../qtquick/qquickpainteditem.html#paint">QQuickPaintedItem::paint</a>() in perform drawing operations with the <a href="../qtgui/qpainter.html">QPainter</a> API. If the class just represented some data type and was not an item that actually needed to be displayed, it could simply inherit from <a href="../qtcore/qobject.html">QObject</a>. Or, if we want to extend the functionality of an existing <a href="../qtcore/qobject.html">QObject</a>-based class, it could inherit from that class instead. Alternatively, if we want to create a visual item that doesn't need to perform drawing operations with the <a href="../qtgui/qpainter.html">QPainter</a> API, we can just subclass <a href="../qtquick/qquickitem.html">QQuickItem</a>.</p>
<p>The <tt>PieChart</tt> class defines the two properties, <tt>name</tt> and <tt>color</tt>, with the Q_PROPERTY macro, and overrides <a href="../qtquick/qquickpainteditem.html#paint">QQuickPaintedItem::paint</a>(). The class implementation in <tt>piechart.cpp</tt> simply sets and returns the <tt>m_name</tt> and <tt>m_color</tt> values as appropriate, and implements <tt>paint()</tt> to draw a simple pie chart. It also turns off the QGraphicsItem::ItemHasNoContents flag to enable painting:</p>
<pre class="cpp">...</pre>
<p>Now that we have defined the <tt>PieChart</tt> type, we will use it from QML. The <tt>app.qml</tt> file creates a <tt>PieChart</tt> item and display the pie chart's details using a standard QML <a href="../qtquick/qml-qtquick2-text.html">Text</a> item:</p>
<pre class="qml"></pre>
<p>Notice that although the color is specified as a string in QML, it is automatically converted to a <a href="../qtgui/qcolor.html">QColor</a> object for the PieChart <tt>color</tt> property. Automatic conversions are provided for various other <a href="qtqml-typesystem-basictypes.html">basic types</a>; for example, a string like &quot;640x480&quot; can be automatically converted to a <a href="../qtcore/qsize.html">QSize</a> value.</p>
<p>We'll also create a C++ application that uses a <a href="../qtquick/qquickview.html">QQuickView</a> to run and display <tt>app.qml</tt>. The application must register the <tt>PieChart</tt> type using the <a href="qqmlengine.html#qmlRegisterType">qmlRegisterType</a>() function, to allow it to be used from QML. If you don't register the type, <tt>app.qml</tt> won't be able to create a <tt>PieChart</tt>.</p>
<p>Here is the application <tt>main.cpp</tt>:</p>
<pre class="cpp"></pre>
<p>This call to <a href="qqmlengine.html#qmlRegisterType">qmlRegisterType</a>() registers the <tt>PieChart</tt> type as a type called &quot;PieChart&quot;, in a type namespace called &quot;Charts&quot;, with a version of 1.0&#x2e;</p>
<p>Lastly, we write a <tt>.pro</tt> project file that includes the files and the <tt>declarative</tt> library:</p>
<pre class="cpp"></pre>
<p>Now we can build and run the application:</p>
