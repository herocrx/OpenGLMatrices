<div class="descr"> <a name="details"></a>
<p>Currently the <tt>PieChart</tt> and <tt>PieSlice</tt> types are used by <tt>app.qml</tt>, which is displayed using a <a href="../qtquick/qquickview.html">QQuickView</a> in a C++ application. An alternative way to use our QML extension is to create a plugin library to make it available to the QML engine. This would allow the <tt>PieChart</tt> and <tt>PieSlice</tt> types to be registered into a type namespace which could be imported by any QML application, instead of restricting these types to be only used by the one application.</p>
<p>The setps for creating a plugin are described in <a href="qtqml-modules-cppplugins.html">Creating C++ Plugins for QML</a>. To start with, we create a plugin class named <tt>ChartsPlugin</tt>. It subclasses <a href="qqmlextensionplugin.html">QQmlExtensionPlugin</a> and registers our QML types in the inherited <a href="qqmlextensionplugin.html#registerTypes">registerTypes()</a> method.</p>
<p>Here is the <tt>ChartsPlugin</tt> definition in <tt>chartsplugin.h</tt>:</p>
<pre class="cpp"></pre>
<p>And its implementation in <tt>chartsplugin.cpp</tt>:</p>
<pre class="cpp"></pre>
<p>Then, we write a <tt>.pro</tt> project file that defines the project as a plugin library and specifies with DESTDIR that library files should be built into a &quot;lib&quot; subdirectory:</p>
<pre class="cpp"></pre>
<p>Finally, we add a <a href="qtqml-modules-qmldir.html">qmldir</a> file that is parsed by the QML engine. In this file, we specify that a plugin named &quot;chapter6-plugin&quot; (the name of the example project) can be found in the &quot;lib&quot; subdirectory:</p>
<pre class="cpp"></pre>
<p>Now we have a plugin, and instead of having a main.cpp and an executable, we can build the project and then load the QML file using the <a href="../qtquick/qtquick-qmlscene.html">qmlscene tool</a>, setting the import path to the current directory so that it finds the <tt>qmldir</tt> file:</p>
<pre class="cpp">qmlscene <span class="operator">-</span>I <span class="operator">.</span> app<span class="operator">.</span>qml</pre>
<p>The module &quot;Charts&quot; will be loaded by the QML engine, and the types provided by that module will be available for use in any QML document which imports it.</p>
