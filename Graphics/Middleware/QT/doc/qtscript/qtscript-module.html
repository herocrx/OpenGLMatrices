<!-- $$$QtScript-brief -->
<p>The Qt Script module provides classes for making Qt applications scriptable. <a href="#details">More...</a></p>
<!-- @@@QtScript -->
<p>This documentation was introduced in qtscript 4.3.</p>

<div class="descr">
<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
<p>The Qt Script module only provides core scripting facilities; the Qt Script Tools module provides additional Qt Script-related components that application developers may find useful.</p>
<p>This module is mainly provided for backwards compatibility reasons with Qt 4.x and not being actively developed any further. For new code please consider using the QJSEngine, etc. classes in the Qt Qml module instead.</p>
<p>To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following directive:</p>
<pre class="cpp"><span class="preprocessor">#include &lt;QtScript&gt;</span></pre>
<p>To link against the module, add this line to your qmake <tt>.pro</tt> file:</p>
<pre class="cpp">QT += script</pre>
<p>For detailed information on how to make your application scriptable with Qt Script, see Making Applications Scriptable.</p>

<h2>License Information</h2>
<p>Qt Commercial Edition licensees that wish to distribute applications that use the Qt Script module need to be aware of their obligations under the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL).</p>
<p>Developers using the Open Source Edition can choose to redistribute the module under the appropriate version of the GNU LGPL.</p>
<p>Commercial customers that do not want to depend on LGPL code can consider using the QJSEngine and QJSValue classes in the Qt Qml module. These classes offer a similar but more narrow scripting API that is sufficient for most use cases and is not dependent on LGPL code.</p>
